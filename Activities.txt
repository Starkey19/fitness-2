	-It must also expose its functionality through a RESTful API that returns
	JSON documents to clients. The RESTful API should be demonstrated using Postman or
	a similar tool.
	-users are able to log-off
	-access /profile/insert profile id or unique email here - same with activities
	-Responsive screen sizing
	- unit testing
	- validation of inputs - dont allow code injection
	- test for GeoJSON using chai : https://github.com/RideAmigosCorp/mongoose-geojson-schema/blob/master/test/GeoJSON.integration.js
Activities
	- Allow users to access other users profiles by a rest url?
	
	- Can be any GeoLocation type activity, e.g RUNS, BIKE RIDES,SWIMS, HIKES
	
	- Users upload activities as GPX files (Which are converted in code to GeoJSON then stored in mongoDB)
	
	- Users can 'review' their activities (so we need to find activities based on users)

	- Users can Search, Sort and compare activities 
		-- Search (search activities by user, activity name)
		-- Sort (Sort activities by name/type, user, distance?)
		-- compare (Compare activities of the same name/type by comparing distance? )
	
	- Appropriate display of activities
		-- GPX/GeoJSON data should be formatted in UI on a map

	- Activities can be 'shared' amongst users 
		-- Have a restful URL e.g /activity/id/10320432
		-- Display activities for a user on /profile with redirects 
			to /activity/id/103203 when clicked
	
	- Comments can be writton on the /activity/id/1920910 page
		-- Use a library for this and an angular page?
		-- Must allow images, videos, blog links etc
